## About my Project

For this project I had to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL. I designed and seeded a database, with which I then built a command-line application that allows the user to :

- Add departments, roles, employees

- View departments, roles, employees

- Update employee roles
